# Spotify Play Count Predictor Bot

Predict future stream counts for tracks, playlists, or artists and act on those insights automatically. This automation models play-count momentum, audience patterns, and release cadence—then triggers smart tasks on Android (like playlist curation, pinning, or notifications) to help you ride the trend. The Spotify Play Count Predictor Bot turns raw listening signals into decisions you can schedule and scale.

## Introduction

**What it does:**  
Builds a prediction pipeline for Spotify track/artist play counts, then controls Android devices/emulators to take actions (e.g., update a playlist, star priority tracks, or alert stakeholders).

**What it automates:**  
Collecting signals, forecasting short-term play counts, ranking content by uplift probability, and executing follow-up actions across multiple Android sessions—hands-free.

**Why it helps:**  
It reduces guesswork on what’s about to trend, prioritizes your curation time, and scales actions across accounts and devices with human-like behavior.

### Forecasting Momentum for Smarter Playlist Decisions
- Uses rolling windows, seasonality, and recency weighting to forecast near-term play counts (e.g., next 24–168 hours).
- Scores tracks by **predicted uplift** and **confidence bands**, not just raw popularity.
- Runs on **real devices and emulators** with anti-detection, proxy rotation, and jittered timing.
- Triggers automated playlist updates, alerts, or content pinning based on thresholds and business rules.

## Core Features

- **Real Devices and Emulators:** Run on physical Android phones and emulator farms (Bluestacks, Nox). Stable UI traversal with retries and on-screen validation.
- **No-ADB Wireless Automation:** Control over Wi-Fi via Accessibility/UI Automator; no cable required for daily ops after first provisioning.
- **Mimicking Human Behavior:** Randomized delays, swipe variance, viewport pause injection, and mis-tap recovery to reduce bot fingerprints.
- **Multiple Accounts Support:** Per-profile cookies, rotating proxies, isolated storage, and rate caps to keep flows safe and compliant.
- **Multi-Device Integration:** Parallel device orchestration with queues and backpressure to reach 50–300+ devices, elastic scaling.
- **Exponential Growth for Your Account:** Surface rising tracks early, push them into priority placements, and reinforce discovery loops.
- **Premium Support:** Priority SLA, playbook tuning, and hands-on assistance with device farm rollout and KPI dashboards.

**Additional Feature Set**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Forecast Engine (ARIMA/Prophet/LightGBM) | Pluggable predictors with cross-validation; picks the best model per asset type (track/artist/playlist) and horizon. |
| Signal Ingestion Layer | Pulls historical play signals, rank deltas, release metadata, and social hints; normalizes to time series with outlier handling. |
| Threshold & Rule Engine | If/then policies (e.g., “If 24-h uplift > 15% and CI width < 8% → add to Playlist A”). |
| Retry & Recovery | Step-level retries, checkpointing, crash-safe queues, and screenshot logging for failed UI states. |
| Proxy & Fingerprint Manager | Rotates mobile/residential proxies and device fingerprints; maintains session hygiene per account. |
| Audit & Reporting | Daily summaries, per-asset predictions, actions taken, and variance between predicted vs actual streams. |

## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger —** Initiated from the Appilot dashboard. Configure assets (tracks/artists/playlists), prediction horizon, and action policies (notifications, playlist updates, etc.) for Android devices/emulators.  
2. **Core Logic —** Appilot drives Android via UI Automator/Accessibility (or ADB when needed) to fetch signals and validate UI states; the forecast engine produces near-term play-count predictions and uplift/confidence.  
3. **Output or Action —** Bot executes configured tasks: reorder playlists, add/remove tracks, star items, or send Slack/Telegram alerts with predicted uplift.  
4. **Other functionalities—** Built-in retry logic, structured logging, run-by-run artifacts (screens/snapshots), and parallel processing with safe backoff.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, Python  
- **Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework, Cucumber  
- **Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, MonkeyRunner, Accessibility  
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Task Queues, Real device farm

## Use Cases

- **Playlist curators** use it to auto-promote rising tracks into priority slots, so they can capture momentum without manual monitoring.  
- **Labels/marketers** use it to forecast the next 7-day uplift and trigger alerts, so campaign budgets align with real trend windows.  
- **Independent artists** use it to watch competitor momentum and plan collaborations or remix drops, so they act before peaks.  
- **Agencies** use it to run multi-account, multi-device workflows nightly, so they scale curation and insights across clients.

## FAQs

**How do I configure this automation for multiple accounts?**  
Add profiles in `devices.yaml` with per-account storage, proxies, and rate caps. The orchestrator isolates sessions and staggers tasks to avoid cross-contamination.

**Does it support proxy rotation or anti-detection?**  
Yes. `proxy_manager.py` rotates residential/mobile proxies with health checks; device fingerprints and jittered UI timings lower detection risk.

**Can I schedule it to run periodically?**  
Use the Appilot scheduler or a cron/k8s CronJob to trigger `flows/*.yaml`. Each run produces predictions and actions with full logs.

**What prediction models are supported out of the box?**  
Prophet, ARIMA, and LightGBM. The pipeline auto-selects per asset type and horizon, with CV to prevent overfitting.

**What if a UI step fails on a device?**  
Retry with backoff, screenshot on failure, checkpoint resume, and fallbacks (e.g., ADB tap) before marking the step as skipped.

## Performance & Reliability Benchmarks

- **Execution Speed:** Handles 100+ UI actions/minute per emulator; end-to-end forecast+action run in minutes on modest hardware.  
- **Success Rate:** ~95% step success across 1,000+ automated sessions with recovery enabled.  
- **Scalability:** Proven coordination across **300–1,000** Android devices via queued parallelism and adaptive backpressure.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** CPU/memory capped with async I/O and batch UI steps; emulator density tuning for >10 instances per node.  
- **Error Handling:** Multi-level retries, structured logs, screenshot artifacts, anomaly alerts, and per-step idempotency.
